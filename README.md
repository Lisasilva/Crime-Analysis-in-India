# Crime Analysis in India

Crime is a behavioural disorderliness which is a result of societal, economical, and 
environmental factors. Currently, analysis of crime is becoming increasingly 
important and has grown to be one of the most popular and widely accepted 
disciplines in the world. There is an increase in violence against women each day, 
and it can take several forms. Rape, Sexual harassment, Dowry, abduction, etc., are 
some of the most committed crimes against women. These crimes result in life-long 
trauma or deaths. Safety and Security of all, not just women, is an absolute right. To 
control the rising crime rate, it is necessary to extract and analyse all relevant data 
on a regular basis and take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of all. 
Government plays a vital role in laying down rules and regulations that protect the 
rights of all the country's citizens.
The generation of this model was done by using the crime data from India for a 
duration of 10 years, from 2001 to 2010. Then a clustering algorithm is selected 
based on the comparison of the clustering methods used in this paper.
